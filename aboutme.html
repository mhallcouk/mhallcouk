            <br/>
            <p class="aboutMeText">I have been using computers since the age of 3. I spent my childhood learning how things worked by disassembling them as well as building various contraptions from Lego, Meccano and K'nex. But now, I'm finally able to live the creative dream using today's modern programming IDE's. Really when you think about programming, it is like have an unlimited amount of Lego?</p>
            <p class="aboutMeText">My first PC had a Pentium III 800MHz and ran Windows 95. I would spend hours using third party editors to add new items to games like the Unreal Tournament and Re-Volt. These tools spiked my interest in computers at an early age, showing that I could in fact be creative by using them.</p>
            <p>The family business has always been the maintenance of computers for various customers, friends and family. Through this I have used a variety of different operating systems from Windows 95 - 10, Mac OSX, Chrome OS and Ubuntu.</p>
            <p class="aboutMeText">I became interested in the idea of programming and software development after seeing the success of Mojang's Minecraft. It intrigued me how a single person was able to make so much from starting with absolutely nothing. I researched the various popular programming languages associated with my favourite platforms and set to work. I've been programming ever since!</p>
            <p class="aboutMeText">My interest in technology has also helped to drive forward my programming hobby. I have always shown a keen interest in the latest computer hardware and smartphones. Soon I hope to work for a company to program professionally.</p>
