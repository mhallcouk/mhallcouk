            <p>I am a developer currently learning the ropes and creating apps in a small village near Banbury in Oxfordshire.</p>
            <p>I'm currently taking courses on modern popular programming languages such as Python and Java, along with Web Design. Though I'm new to this industry, I am picking up the skills quickly.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on some Android apps that will eventually make their way on to the Google Play Store, as well as a few other personal projects.</p>
            <p>I have plans to create apps for iOS, following the success of my apps created on Android, though this will certainly be after I've finished mastering Java fully as a programming language.</p>

                <p class="col-sm-4">The first project, other than this website, I made in JavaScript. It seemed like a wise decision as a first "Turing Complete" programming language due to its use in almost every internet browser. I made a simple clone of pong to really get the hang of making a JS based program.</p>

                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">I decided to take on a sligtly more advanced task and create a CodePlayer similar to the one found on JS Bin. This was to further my JavaScript skills for future projects. It is also the first big project that has heavily featured JQuery. <a href="codeplayer.html">Try out CodePlayer here!</a></p>

                <p class="col-sm-4">As WordPress is such a key part of web design, I decided to create a blog website. It is well known that 25% of all websites use WordPress in their construction. This is because when a website is sold to a client, that client may not be able to code. WordPress allows the client to make changes and update their website with ease. My new blog will be available at the sister website <strong>mhall.me.uk</strong> very soon!</p>

                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">There are more devices in the world that run Android than any other operating system in existence. Android also uses the Java programming language for its functionality. So naturally Android was the mobile platform that I studied first.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <img id="androidpreview" class="col-sm-4" src="calculator.png"/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">The first project was an incredibly simple calculator. A this point the user interface was not a priority. I just wanted to make a working app, to show that I could do it. It worked! The calculator was able to take 2 numbers as arguments, perform the calculation required, then update the display with the result.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <img id="androidpreview" class="col-sm-4" src="top100downloader.png"/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">My second project was to create a simple RSS reader. This would go to a pre-specified RSS feed of my choice, and using asynchronous java commands, retrieve and decode the XML file so that it could be displayed. The app would then show the results on the screen in a meaningful way. Again, with this project, the main focus was on learning a function rather than user interface (or lack thereof). These first two apps arenâ€™t really worthy of the Google Play Store, however future apps will be more user interface centric.</p>

            <h2>React Native Projects</h2>

                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">React Native is a cross-platform framework developed by Facebook that uses compiled JavaScript to create apps. The JavaScript is compiled into the phone's native language to increase the speed of the app. Whilst on paper the thought of a framework to make cross-platform apps sounds good, in reality you miss out on some of the native features on each platform. React Native makes it quick to create apps, but they lack the speed of creating the app in it's native language.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <img id="androidpreview" class="col-sm-4" src="stopwatch.png"/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">For practice in creating apps in React Native, I created a basic stopwatch. The stopwatch features a start/stop button that changes when pressed, and lap timer button. Whilst the app was quite quick to make, the trouble comes when reaching lap 13 and 14. A certain amount of lag enters the app making it less than useful as a functional stopwatch. React Native does not seem to have the raw horsepower of its native counterparts. I will carry on my development in React Native, but I would recommend against using it for any realtime apps.</p>

                <br/>
                <p class="col-sm-4">iOS apps for the iPhone and iPad have the highest return on investment of any native mobile app. Despite the iOS App Store only selling half as many apps as the Google Play Store, the financial income for developers is approximately double. This equates to each iOS app making 4x the amount of profit when compared to their Android equivalent. iOS users are more likely on average to pay for an app. iOS apps are composed of either the Objective-C or Swift programming languages, the latter of which is the main focus of Apple's efforts. I therefore decided to learn Swift as my first iOS language with the intention of learning Objective-C if it was later required.</p>
